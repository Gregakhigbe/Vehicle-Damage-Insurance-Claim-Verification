# Vehicle-Damage-Insurance-Claim-Verification
This study produced a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify vehicle insurance claims based on six damage categories. A dataset of 7200 labelled images was pre-processed, and three CNN models were trained and compared. The selected architecture involved three convolutional layers, max-pooling operations, a dense layer, and a SoftMax output. The model's performance was evaluated, showing slight overfitting and good generalization on unobserved data.
